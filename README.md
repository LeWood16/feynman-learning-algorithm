### Algorithm for Learning Faster and More Comprehensively

Typically when we learn a new language, new concept, new skill, or even a new word, we tend to lose that knowledge to some degree if we don't keep up on it.  Cramming all night for an exam may get you a good grade, but without using that knowledge regularly after that exam, it's clear to your brain that it just isn't important anymore.  That's because our brains are amazingly efficient, and only keep what is "necessary."  If we don't use it, we lose it.

This usually isn't a problem if we use what we learn on a regular basis.  Neural pathways stay strong, and only get stronger with time and contant use.  In the case of software developers, the knowledge and skillset needed to stay on the cutting edge keeps growing, shifting and evolving every day.  The next logical step is to figure out a simple, efficient way to use every piece of important knowledge you learn on a regular basis, to avoid losing what you learn.

Feyman Network is my first attempt at this algorithm.
