Fixes:
- put routes in "routes" directory, rather than having one big
monolithic express app

- updateTerm is an exact copy of createTerm, make it into a unique function:
   - get and store all the old values of the term by querying the database
   - use the old values to find the _id value of that term
   - using the _id, update all the values with the new values, leaving the _id intact
   - push the changes to the database
   - reload the page (or at least the divs on the page that changed)




Features:



- able to click on a term, and be taken to a page with options for 
that term
  - edit
  - delete
  - change "due" interval (default is one week)
- edit current terms
- track when you created terms
- track when you last edited terms
- create a schema property that gets populated when you last
edited a term, and use that property (probably another dateobject)
to check if a term is "due"
  - a term is "due" if the due property is after the current date
- set an "inbox" that fills with a list of words once 


(you can review a term at any time, not just when it comes due;
the due time will update for a term whenever you review it)
1. you add a term (term, definition, examples) to the db
2. that term is "due" 7 days after it's created
3. after the "due" time, the term shows up in your "due" section
   for review
4. you review it
   a. you enter the definition, and examples
   b. you hit "update," and the old and new entries are shown
      side-by-side
   c. you click which entry to keep, and the other is discarded
   d. the "due" time is reset
